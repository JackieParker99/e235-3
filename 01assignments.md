## Research Logs

Each week you will document what you are learning in English 235 via a Research Log Entry. The goal of these entries is for you to capture the in-process moments of insight and learning, including the posing of questions. For each entry, I will offer some brief instructions via the course site as a starting point, and you are encouraged to extend your entries beyond these instructions as unanticipated things emerge in your work. These log entries wil also serve as a resource for the self-evaluations that will be central to our assessment of your work in the course. 

## Mini Projects 

At the beginning of the quarter we will engage in several mini projects/experiments that explore Technical Writing as a process of translation. Our jumping off point for these mini-projects/experiments will be Karen Dale Welsh's ["Poetry, Visual Design and the How-To Manual: Creativity in the Teaching of Technical Writing"](https://ezproxy.pierce.ctc.edu:2057/docview/237307200/fulltext/EA8940D7FEA24DE2PQ/1?accountid=2280) (2010). 


## Project: PierceHacker

In this project students will contribute materials to the [PierceHacker](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/) project website.

## Project: Composing an Open Educational Resource

Working in collaborative small groups, in this project students will compose a chapter in for [OER Textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) to be used in future ENGLISH 235 courses at Pierce.


## Project: Composing a Community Resource

Working in collaborative small groups, in this project students will identify a problem or issue on campus or in their community that requires detailed technical instructions, policies and/or procudures to solve. 

As technical writers, students will attempt to intervene in this problem by producing a technical communications resource in response to this particular problem/issue that is of use to their community. 


## Note

More detailed instructions for these projects will provided. The above descriptions are thumbnail sketches of the projects.

In all our work this quarter we will engage in processes of drafting, feedback and revision. We want to become better aware of how our work interacts with audiences and how it can be worked on to do useful for work for these audiences in the world.


###Course Reading

We have no require text in this class. We will, however, occasionally have both assigned and self-selected readings. These will be posted to the course schedule as needed.
