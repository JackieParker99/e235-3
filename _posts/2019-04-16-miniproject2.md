In this mini-project/workshop I want you to locate and read through/attempt to use at least 5 or guides for *writing with Markdown*. Attempt to use what you learn in the tutorials to add the following style/format elements to your Research Log(s):

* Headers
* Lists
* Blockquotes
* Emphasis
* Images
* Links
* Horizontal Rule

After attempting to apply some formatting/style to your Research Logs, compose a new Markdown document in your repository. In this document, rank the tutorials you consulted in your order of preference  in terms of usability. Provide a rationale for each of these rankings. And...remember to use appropriate formatting/style elemnts like *links*, etc.
